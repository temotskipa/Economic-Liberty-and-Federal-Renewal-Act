### SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES

**(a) Findings.**—Congress finds the following:

(1) The accumulation of federal regulations has created barriers to entry and compliance costs that disproportionately advantage large corporations over small businesses and innovators, stifling competition and economic growth.

(2) Intellectual property laws, in practice, function as government-granted monopolies that enrich incumbents at the expense of consumers and new entrants, rather than as genuine property rights.

(3) The federal budget is unsustainable, with fiscal year 2025 expenditures significantly exceeding revenues, resulting in a substantial deficit driven by entitlement programs, redundant agencies, and inefficient welfare spending.

(4) Social Security, Medicare, and other welfare programs can trap individuals in dependency and crowd out private savings and charity.

(5) The current tax system is complex, distortionary, and punitive, discouraging work, investment, and savings.

(6) The Federal Reserve System has enabled unchecked monetary expansion, inflation, and financial instability, undermining the dollar's value and economic liberty.

(7) A free banking system based on sound money—such as commodity-backed currencies—would foster competition, stability, and innovation in money and credit.

(8) The reforms in this Act are intended to unleash entrepreneurial energy, reduce federal overreach, and move toward a balanced budget, consistent with the principles of federalism embodied in the Constitution.

(9) Under the original meaning of the Constitution, federal power is limited to enumerated powers in Article I, section 8; the Commerce Clause regulates trade among the several States, not intrastate activities or non-commercial matters.

(10) The Spending Clause permits taxation and spending for the general welfare only in aid of enumerated powers, without coercing States or funding unenumerated welfare programs.

(11) Federal regulatory authority does not extend to labor markets, environmental protection, or general welfare absent enumerated powers; such matters belong primarily to the States.

(12) Monetary policy must adhere to the coinage power, and a value-added tax can be structured as a uniform excise under the tax power.

**(b) Purposes.**—The purposes of this Act include—

(1) dismantling regulatory capture and cronyism;\
(2) achieving rapid progress toward a balanced federal budget;\
(3) simplifying and neutralizing the tax code through a consumption-based system;\
(4) restoring sound money and banking freedom; and\
(5) enacting complementary measures to maximize economic liberty.

(1) **In general.**—There is hereby imposed a value-added tax (in this title referred to as the "VAT") on the sale of taxable goods and services consumed in the United States, effective January 1, 2026. The VAT shall be imposed on the value added at each stage of production and distribution, and shall be administered on a destination basis so that imports are taxed and exports are zero-rated.

(2) **Taxable person.**—The VAT shall be imposed on any taxable person, defined for purposes of this section as any individual, corporation, partnership, trust, estate, or other entity that, in the ordinary course of a trade or business, makes taxable supplies of goods or services in the United States in excess of the registration threshold specified in subsection (g).

(2) any such adjustment shall not increase any rate by more than 5 percentage points or decrease any rate by more than 5 percentage points in a single year; and

The Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulation define the customs territory and rules for determining the place of supply, including special rules for electronically supplied services, telecommunications, and cross-border services.

**(f) Credit-invoice mechanism.**—

(1) **Credits.**—A taxable person shall be entitled to a credit against VAT imposed on that person’s taxable supplies for the VAT properly invoiced and paid on taxable purchases of goods and services used in the course of the person’s trade or business.

(3) **Refunds.**—If, for a taxable period, the credits allowable under this subsection exceed the VAT imposed on a taxable person’s taxable supplies, the excess shall be refunded to the taxable person within 90 days after the filing of a complete return, or such shorter period as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe.

(4) **Restrictions.**—The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulation deny or limit credits for specified categories of expenditures, including entertainment, passenger vehicles not primarily used in a trade or business, and mixed-use items, in order to prevent abuse and to promote administrative simplicity.

(4) **Cancellation of registration.**—The Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulation provide for the cancellation of registration where a person’s taxable turnover falls below the threshold in paragraph (1) and the person does not elect to remain registered.

**(h) Returns and payment.**—

(1) **Filing requirement.**—Each taxable person shall file a VAT return for each taxable period (which shall be a calendar quarter unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) not later than 30 days after the close of such period.

(2) **Contents.**—The return shall state—

**(k) Coordination with other law.**—The VAT established by this section shall be in lieu of the taxes repealed by section 301. Amounts collected under this section shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury and shall be available, subject to appropriation Acts, to meet obligations of the United States, including obligations to pay vested benefits preserved under sections 201 and 205. Nothing in this title shall be construed to limit the authority of the United States to impose customs duties or excise taxes related to national defense or foreign affairs, if separately authorized by Act of Congress.

**(l) Judicial review of classifications.**—Any classification of goods or services under subsection (b) shall be subject to review by the United States Tax Court.

**(b) Funding.**-The Fund shall be funded primarily from proceeds of agency asset auctions under section 101(e).

**(c) No creation of Federal common law.**-Nothing in this Act shall be construed to create a general Federal common law of torts or property.
